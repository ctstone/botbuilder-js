# botbuilder-dialogs
These samples show examples of using the [botbuilder-dialogs](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-js/doc/botbuilder-dialogs/README.md) package to manage a bots conversation flows using a dialog stack.

## Running
To run these samples first clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-js.git
```

Change to the botbuilder-js director:

```bash
cd botbuilder-js
```

Install [Lerna](https://lernajs.io/) and then bootstrap all dependencies:

```bash
npm install --global lerna@3.2.1
lerna bootstrap --hoist
```

Now change into the directory of the sample you'd like to run and execute `npm run start`. For examples ending with a `-ts` you will also need the latest TypeScript compiler installed:

```bash
npm install --global typescript
```
